PURPOSE
==========
The attcontrol module is designed to allow instructors of a course keep an attcontrol log of the students in their courses. The instructor will setup the frequency of his classes (# of days per week & length of course) and the attcontrol is ready for use. To take attendance, the instructor clicks on the "Update attcontrol" button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course, along with different attendance statuses: Present, Absent, Late, Excused, etc. with a Remarks textbox. Instructors can download the reports for their courses in Excel, OpenOffice/LibreOffice or text format.
Only the instructor can update the attcontrol data. However, a student gets to see his attcontrol record.
